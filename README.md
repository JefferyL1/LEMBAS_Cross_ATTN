# Utilizing Cross-Attention with LEMBAS to determine off-target effects of drugs

Here we implement the idea of cross-attention into LEMBAS - a biologically constrained neural network representing the interceullar signaling pathways - to determine the off-target effects of drugs. 
This work is largely built on previous work from the Lauffenburger Lab, specifically the LEMBAS network [^1] and the applications of LEMBAS to off-target effects of drugs[^2].
